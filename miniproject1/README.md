# Mini Project 1 - Philippine Astronomy Magazine

This is my first miniproject for the [KodeGo Web Developer Course](https://kodego.ph/courses/1) I am currently taking.

**_Update_: I have finished the template for this project.**

* [View the template](template/)

**_Update_: Uploaded website with placeholder pages. Slowly building content.**

**_Update_: The project has been submitted.**

* [See the final version](home/)

**_Update_: This folder is now frozen.**

* To preserve the state when it was submitted, no more changes will be made to this folder.

* This folder has been forked into the [philippine-astronomy](/philippine-astronomy/) folder.

* All subsequent updates to this website shall occur at that folder instead.

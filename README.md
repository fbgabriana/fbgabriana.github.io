# Bamm's KodeGo Repository

This is my public repository for KodeGo bootcamp projects.

It contains the following folders:

* [proposals](proposals/) - My KodeGo project proposals.

* [miniproject1](miniproject1/) - a requirement for KodeGo's web development course. No changes will be made to this folder to preserve the state when it was submitted.

* [harmonicmeans](harmonicmeans/) - Website of Harmonic Means, my sister's musical band.

* [philippine-astronomy](philippine-astronomy/) - Philippine Astronomy Magazine, continuation of miniproject1.

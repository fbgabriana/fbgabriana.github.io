# Bamm's KodeGo Repository

This is my public repository for KodeGo bootcamp projects.

It contains the following folders:

* [proposals](proposals/) - My KodeGo project proposals.

* [miniproject1](miniproject1/) - a requirement for KodeGo's web development course.

	- To preserve the state when it was submitted, no more changes will be made to this folder.

	- All subsequent development to the site has been moved to the philippine-astronomy folder.

* [philippine-astronomy](philippine-astronomy/) - _Philippine Astronomy Magazine_, a continuation of miniproject1.

* [harmonicmeans](harmonicmeans/) - Website of _Harmonic Means_, my sister's musical band.
